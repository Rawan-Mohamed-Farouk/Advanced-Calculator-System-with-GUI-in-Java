Project Title: Advanced Calculator System with GUI in Java

Description:
The Advanced Calculator System with GUI is a comprehensive calculator application developed in Java using Java Swing for the graphical user interface. This project supports a wide range of arithmetic operations including addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, modulus, and exponentiation. Additionally, the calculator can perform operations on lists of numbers (addition and multiplication) and calculate the factorial of a number using a recursive function. The application is designed to be user-friendly, providing a straightforward interface for users to perform complex calculations. It also includes an option for users to exit the program by pressing 'Q'.

What I Learned:
    Java Programming:
        Gained proficiency in Java, including fundamental syntax and advanced features.
        Utilized Java's switch case statement to handle various calculator operations.

    Graphical User Interface (GUI) Development:
        Designed and implemented a user-friendly interface using Java Swing.
        Managed layout and components such as buttons, text fields, and labels.

    Event Handling:
        Implemented event listeners to handle user interactions with the GUI.
        Developed logic to perform calculations based on user inputs.

    Recursive Functions:
        Applied recursion to calculate the factorial of a number efficiently.

    Data Structures:
        Managed and manipulated lists of numbers for operations like addition and multiplication.

    Software Design Principles:
        Applied object-oriented design principles to create a modular and maintainable codebase.
        Ensured code readability and reusability through proper class structure and methods.

    Debugging and Testing:
        Conducted thorough testing to ensure the accuracy of all calculations.
        Debugged and resolved issues to improve the stability of the application.

    Version Control:
        Gained experience with Git for version control.
        Learned to push code to a GitHub repository, enhancing collaborative and version tracking skills.
